# Wordle Solver

A React-app that can help solve Wordle puzzles. Enter the text and set the colours returned from the Wordle app, and the solver updates a dropdown with all possible word solutions.

Also works with [octokatherine](https://github.com/octokatherine/word-master)'s version, which has a much larger selection of words.

P.s. I know it could be improved, but it was developed in one evening...
